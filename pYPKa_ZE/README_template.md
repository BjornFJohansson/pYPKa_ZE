# Yeast pathway kit promoter and terminator vectors

This list contain a total of regulatory sequences cloned in in the [pYPKa](files/pYPKa.gb) vector.

Promoters were cloned  in either the [ZraI](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/ZraI.html)
or the [EcoRV](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/EcoRV.html) site.

Plasmids with an insert in [ZraI](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/ZraI.html) are named
pYPKa_Z_* and plasmids with an insert in [EcoRV](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/EcoRV.html) are named
pYPKa_E_*. Inserts in ZraI and EcoRV can be used as promoters and terminators, respectively.

Each vector is described py an IPython notebook.
